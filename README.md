# Numpy To Optimized Jax

**Motivation**: This repo was originally a series of lessons introducing Jax concepts, and it can still be used for that. However, it has also advanced beyond that to include 
example code solving various real-world problems. These case-studies themselves can be used as a follow-up lesson for those who have finished the first lesson.

**Blurb**: Jax is often thought of as Numpy for the GPU, but it is so much more (both in terms of features, and sharp edges). The tutorials presented here—one aimed at a general audience and the other at computational neuroscientists—were inspired by a roadblock I encountered in my research. Specifically, I was working on a LIF simulation problem that, despite using vectorized Numpy, took excessively long to run. By incorporating Jax into my workflow and iterating on it, I managed to reduce the runtime from ~10 seconds to ~0.2 seconds.

## Exercises:

The `exercises` folder contains the code structured as a series of exercises for you to work through to reinforce the concepts.

### L1: Jax Function Calls

### L2 Jax JIT: 

- Using `jit`

- Understanding **when** to use jit a.k.a why not jit everything?

- Timing `jax`

### L3 Jax loops: 

- reading haskell-like function signatures

- `fori_loop`, `while_loop`, `scan`

### L4: Misc. Using vmap

- make your code look more like the math described in the papers

### L5: Profiling your code

- in prior notebooks we had introduced methods to speed up code, and the JIT compilation. Let's investigate if and how much they speed up code!

### Bonus: using Einsum for more readable code

Einsum isn't specific to Jax, but it's still useful to know!

## Case Studies

Case studies build on the exercises and rely on concepts covered in the lessons. In the case studies we see the concepts applied to real-world problems.

# Work in progress:

- [ ] Randomness in JAX
  - reproducible randomness across machines across accelerators
- [ ] pmap
  - Introduction to parallel execution with examples using multiple devices. Having said that, this should still work even with a single device
- [ ] grad
  - and grad_and_val to get the gradient
- [ ] GMM Advanced
  - Add in `rng` and `pmap` to a separate notebook
